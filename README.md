## My process
I got to use a lot of my learnings and apply them to the challenge. I'm not fully satisfied with how the social media links at the bottom turned out, but it was the way I managed to make them look like the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got to experiment with flexbox and undestand it a little better. Very nice for responsive websites.
